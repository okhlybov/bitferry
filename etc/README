## Installation

### Runtime prerequisites

* Ruby runtime

* Rclone executable

* Restic executable

There are several options available for obtaining Bitferry:

### GEM package

Being a Ruby code, the Bitferry requires the platform-specific Ruby runtime, version 3.0 or higher. Next, the platform-specific Rclone and Restic executables are also required to be accessible through the `PATH` directory list or through the respective `RCLONE` and `RESTIC` environment variables.

For Windows, the recommended Ruby vendor is [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/). Any Ruby 3 build should Rubybe OK, however; a 32-bit version can be used in either 32 ot 64 -bit Windows. Specifically, this one [Win32 Ruby version 3.2](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/download/RubyInstaller-3.2.3-1/rubyinstaller-3.2.3-1-x86.exe) should be fine.



For UNIX, the runtime installation is system-specific. For instance,

- Debian/Ubuntu Linuxutilities
  
  ```shell
  sudo apt install ruby rclone restic
  ```
* Arch Linux
  
  ```shell
  sudo pacman -S ruby rclone restic
  ```

Once the platform-specific prerequisites are installed the Bitferry itself is one command away

```shell
gem install bitferry
```

The rest of platform-specific prerequisite are obtainable form the respective download pages [Rclone](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/releases) and [Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases). As these programs are under active development, it is recommended to grab the latest versions. Note that there is no need to match the bitness of the three components (32-bit Ruby runtime has no trouble spawning 64-bit Rclone, for instance).





Despite all claims the online cloud backup is unreliable and thus it is very unwise to use it as the main (if only) backup solution.
